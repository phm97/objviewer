# objviewer
**Description:**
Obj Viewer is a basic Wavefront object file loader made with GTK+2.0, GtkGLExt and OpenGL 1.2


**Features:**
objviewer does not support Mtl files yet. This may come in the future.
Texture files are loaded with GdkPixbuf. The supported file formats are the following :
- bmp
- tga
- jpeg
- png
- tiff
- and more

**Installation:**
To build objviewer, install the following dependencies :
- GNU make
- GTK+ 2
- GtkGLExt

**Notes:**
Maybe I will port this little app to GTK+ 3 and OpenGL 3.3 in the future, but nothing is planed for the moment.
